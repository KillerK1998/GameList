# Overview
This program was meant as a continuation to my training to better my skills in C++

In this prograam I decided to make a program that stores favorite movies from best to worst.

I decided to make this program because this program was always one of the programs I would make to test out my knowledge and I figured that this program would tie in what I learned into a single program.

# Development Environment

I coded this program in Visual Studio using some of the coding libraries that it has to offer

The code provided in this progam was done in C++, the libraries that were included in this program were vector, string, iostream, and a couple of other libraries in C++ to make this program run.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- improve this code by adding other features such as removing movies from the list
- giving the user the option to select options aside from adding movies from a list
- add a function that I would use to enable the user to view the list
